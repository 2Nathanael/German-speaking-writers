The correlation between the Habitus and the predilection themes of German speaking writers according to Wikipedia

The aim of this project is to study the correlation relationships between the biographical background of the German speaking writters and the topics they wrote about according to their Wikipedia pages. In this purpose, the research question is addressed as follows: Which correlation relationships can we observe between this background and the topics? This means: To what extend can we observe convergences between certain backgrounds - for example: the education type - and certain topics - for example: love - by a significant numer of German speaking writers?

As example project for the use of Digital Methodology, the answer to these questions relies on two database. On the one hand a SQL database. In order to create this database, it will be necessary to define all the classes and proprieties which are relevant for the creation of the database, as well as the relationships between them. On the other hand, Wikidata will be queried by SPARQL queries. At the end of the projects, some results from Wikidata are imported into SQL.
