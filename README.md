The correlation between the Habitus and the predilection themes of German speaking writers according to Wikipedia

The aim of this project is to study the correlation between the "habitus" of German-language writers according to the themes these writers have dealt with according to Wikipedia, i.e. to compare writers according to their themes. The problem to be addressed here is as follows: To what extent do writers who have written on a theme converge or diverge?

In this research, the "habitus" will be composed of the following 7 criterias, which are the objects:

Period
Gender
Socio-economical conditions of the family
Marriage
Places of activity
Education
Associative life
The subjects would be the German speaking Writers figuring on the following Wikipedia list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German-language_authors as of 09.10.2023.

The classes would be the predilection themes of the writers, for example: Societal conditions, love, faith, nature.
